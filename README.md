# Ghar Tak

## Project Overview
**Ghar Tak** is a service platform bridging urban and rural communities by connecting urban users with reliable, verified rural workers for household tasks like plumbing, cleaning, and repairs. The platform addresses common issues like high service fees, low worker incentives, and limited availability. By simplifying access to affordable help while providing fair compensation and incentives for rural workers, Ghar Tak aims to transform the gig economy.

## Problem Statement
In urban areas, finding reliable, affordable help for household tasks can be challenging due to high prices and limited availability. Meanwhile, rural workers face limited job opportunities and low wages, with unemployment rates reaching 7.2% in rural areas. Many existing platforms are complex, costly, and inefficient, making it hard for both service seekers and providers to connect effectively.

## Proposed Solution
**Ghar Tak Service** offers a streamlined solution that connects urban users with rural workers through a secure, user-friendly platform, enabling:
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Workers can negotiate prices based on job requirements.
- **Job Matching**: Real-time geolocation connects users with the nearest available workers.
- **Incentives & Benefits**: Workers earn performance-based bonuses and have access to insurance benefits.
- **Rehiring Options**: Users can rehire previously trusted workers for consistent service.

## Key Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified navigation for posting jobs and selecting workers.
- **Dynamic Pricing & Task Matching**: Algorithms match users and workers based on location and job type.
- **Real-Time Tracking & Notifications**: Users can track worker arrival and progress.
- **Verified Worker Registration**: Workers undergo document verification to ensure reliability and safety.
- **Performance-Based Incentives**: Workers earn rewards and benefits based on performance and loyalty.

## Technical Description
- Built on scalable cloud infrastructure, supporting real-time geolocation and seamless user interactions.
- Automated matching algorithms for efficient service delivery.
- Real-time tracking and updates enhance user experience and trust.
